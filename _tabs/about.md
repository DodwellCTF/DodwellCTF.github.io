# About Me

Hey there! My name is Brayden Dodwell, and I am a university student at Sheffield Hallam University, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Cyber Security. In January of 2023, I stumbled upon the fascinating world of Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, and I have been hooked ever since.

As a newbie to the CTF scene, I quickly realized that there was so much to learn and so many challenges to overcome. However, I was determined to push myself and hone my skills in various areas of cyber security, such as cryptography, steganography, web exploitation, and more. That's why I decided to start a blog, where I could document my CTF journey, consolidate my knowledge, and hopefully help and inspire others who are also new to this exciting world.

Through my blog, I share my CTF writeups, where I explain the thought processes, techniques, and tools that I used to solve different challenges. I also share tips and tricks that I've learned along the way and highlight the resources and communities that have been instrumental in my growth.

If you find my blog helpful or would like to connect with me to discuss cyber security or CTF competitions, please feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brayden-dodwell-252515257). I'm always interested in hearing from others about tips, learning, or internship opportunities that may help me grow further in my field.

In addition to my CTF pursuits, I am also an active member of the cyber security community at Sheffield Hallam University. I participate in hackathons, attend conferences and events, and collaborate with other students to work on various cyber security projects.

Overall, I am excited to continue my journey in the world of CTF and cyber security and to see where it takes me. I hope that my blog can help others who are also on this journey and inspire them to push themselves and reach their full potential.
